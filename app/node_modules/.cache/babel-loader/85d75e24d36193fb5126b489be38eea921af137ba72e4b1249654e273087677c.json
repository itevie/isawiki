VERY WELL. TOO WELL FOR ANYONE'S BENEFIT.**\n- subcon signalling doesn't work.   \n\n# Re: NLP\nlittle note: ironically kirsch did look at NLP and then proceeded to do experiments disproving it :)\n- anything relating to rapport has been disproven\n- therapy via NLP stuff has been proven to be worse than what's standard\n- double induction doesn't work :) - again, the simple stuff was better **XDDDDDD**\n\nCBT + hypno has better results than CBT alone\nweight loss thingy: hypno increased weight loss, and also helped keep that weight loss (which usually doesn't happen)\nhypno analgesia: \n- More suggestible = higher effect this has\n- 75% has substantial relief\n- Reduces need for medication\n\t- SIGNIFICANCE: we've thought about this before, opioid crisis can sum it up. \n- NEUROLOGICAL CONNECTIONS!?!?!?!?\n- Surgery without anaesthesia \n\n# le trance :)\n- ## myth: you need trance (esp for harder suggestions), deeper trance = \"deeper\" phenomena\n\t- Nope. **STATE THEORY WAR :)))))))**\n\t- ### HOWEVER (caveat):\n\t\t- inductions help by 20% :)\n\t\t- _personal comment: think bedside effect_\n- ### Stroop effect experiment:\n\t- Stroop effect can be reduced via suggestions\n\t- Induction or not, results were similar. \n- ### Seeing color:\n\t- you can get the left fusiform (involved in percieving color) to be active via suggestion\n\t- the setup was add color to a black and white image\n- ### pain relief:\n\t- open to suggestion documentary (1999)\n- ## neurosci behind this stuff:\n\t- high's show reduction in the brain called the \"default mode\"\n\t\t- default mode is the \"doing nothing\" mode of existence\n\t\t- as soon as you engage in a task, lowered default mode. \n\t- _Mild conclusion: you're actively engaged while in the state, i.e. high's are engaging in the task of hypno _\n\t\t- Thus: (copied verbatim) Hypno is a normal state of focused attention in whic you are motivated and trying to do something\n\t\t- Hypno is impacted by:\n\t\t\t- Willingness\n\t\t\t- Ability\n\t\t\t- belief (expectancy)\n\t\t\t- cognitive effort - no passive sitting round\n\t\t- **THE INDUCTION INCREASES SAID MOTIVATION, EXPECTANCY, AND EFFORT :)**\n\t- low's don't do this \"default mode\" thingy. \n\n# convincing people that they were good hypnotic subjects:\n- haven't done hypno before\n- assess hypnotizability on control\n- for the other group, convincer was red light in the room (while suggesting that the room was becoming red)\n_interruption: why am I able to do this effect now all of a sudden...this is getting out of hand_\n- and other lights too (blue, green, flickering room lights)\n- **RESULTS:**\n![[Pasted image 20250203175406.png]]\n**this is insane.**\n### What's even more insane:\n- During debrief, panel of lights were shown. \n- Post showing all of that, tested again for hypnotizability\n\t- AND THEY REMAINED THE SAME. WHAAAAAAA-\n- You show them that they can do it, they now can do it :)\n\n# antidepressants and depression:\n- did meta-analysis on it\n- instantly got lead front page on news platforms\n- invited him to write a book about it (The Emperor's New Drugs - Exploding The Antidepressant Myth)\n## How did he uncover this?\n- 40% of trials are not published by pharma\n- Used FOIA and obtained them. \n- Published: 3/4 show significant difference\n- Unpublished: 88% show **no diff :)**\n## Background on depression stuff:\n- Depression is (was?) scored on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression\n\t- Ranges from 0-51 points\n### Now...\n- Drugs got an average 10 point improvement\n\t- clinically meaningful improvement\n- **Placebos got 8.35 points of improvement**\n- ...\n- Difference was 18% in drug effect, **Placebo is 82% of effect**\n- Mean difference on the Hamilton Scale was 1.8\n- **For it to be clinically significant, at least a 3 point change must be observed in placebo vs drug.**\n- yeah. \n- ALSO: **IT'S NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. 90% OF PEOPLE HAVE NO EFFECT UPON CONSUMPTION OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS.**`.replace(\n                  /\\n/g,\n                  \"  \\n\"\n                )}\n              </Markdown>\n            </Container>\n            <Container\n              style={{ width: \"350px\", minWidth: \"100px\" }}\n              title=\"Something\"\n            ></Container>\n          </Row>\n        </Column>\n      </Content>\n    </Row>\n  );\n}\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,QAAQ,MAAM,gBAAgB;AACrC,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,6BAA6B;AAChD,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,6BAA6B;AAChD,OAAOC,SAAS,MAAM,gCAAgC;AACtD,OAAOC,OAAO,MAAM,8BAA8B;AAClD,OAAOC,kBAAkB,MAAM,yCAAyC;AACxE,OAAOC,GAAG,MAAM,0BAA0B;AAC1C,OAAOC,OAAO,MAAM,8BAA8B;AAClD,OAAOC,KAAK,MAAM,4BAA4B;AAC9C,OAAOC,SAAS,MAAM,YAAY;AAClC,OAAO,aAAa;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAErB,eAAe,SAASC,GAAGA,CAAA,EAAG;EAC5B,oBACED,OAAA,CAACL,GAAG;IAACO,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;IAAAC,QAAA,gBACxBH,OAAA,CAACJ,OAAO;MAAAO,QAAA,gBACNH,OAAA,CAACH,KAAK;QAACO,IAAI,EAAC,YAAY;QAACC,KAAK,EAAE;UAAEC,SAAS,EAAE;QAAS,CAAE;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAC;MAEzD;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAO,CAAC,eACRV,OAAA;QAAAO,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAK,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACC,CAAC,eACVV,OAAA,CAACP,OAAO;MAACkB,IAAI,EAAE,CAAC,WAAW,CAAE;MAACN,KAAK,EAAE;QAAEO,SAAS,EAAE;MAAS,CAAE;MAAAT,QAAA,eAC3DH,OAAA,CAACT,MAAM;QAACoB,IAAI,EAAE,CAAC,WAAW,CAAE;QAAAR,QAAA,gBAC1BH,OAAA,CAACH,KAAK;UAACO,IAAI,EAAC,YAAY;UAAAD,QAAA,EAAC;QAAY;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAO,CAAC,eAC7CV,OAAA,CAACL,GAAG;UAAAQ,QAAA,gBACFH,OAAA,CAACL,GAAG;YAACgB,IAAI,EAAE,CAAC,WAAW,EAAE,WAAW,CAAE;YAAAR,QAAA,EACnC,CAAC,MAAM,EAAE,MAAM,EAAE,MAAM,CAAC,CAACU,GAAG,CAAEC,CAAC,iBAC9Bd,OAAA,CAACV,MAAM;cAACqB,IAAI,EAAE,CAAC,OAAO,CAAE;cAAAR,QAAA,eACtBH,OAAA,CAACL,GAAG;gBAACgB,IAAI,EAAE,CAAC,WAAW,CAAE;gBAAAR,QAAA,gBACvBH,OAAA,CAACN,kBAAkB;kBAACqB,IAAI,EAAC,MAAM;kBAACC,IAAI,EAAC;gBAAM;kBAAAT,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;kBAAAC,UAAA;kBAAAC,YAAA;gBAAA,OAAE,CAAC,EAC7CI,CAAC;cAAA;gBAAAP,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;gBAAAC,UAAA;gBAAAC,YAAA;cAAA,OACC;YAAC;cAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OACA,CACT;UAAC;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACC,CAAC,eACNV,OAAA,CAACL,GAAG;YAACgB,IAAI,EAAE,CAAC,cAAc,CAAE;YAACN,KAAK,EAAE;cAAEY,SAAS,EAAE;YAAc,CAAE;YAAAd,QAAA,EAAC;UAElE;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAK,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACH,CAAC,eACNV,OAAA,CAACL,GAAG;UAAAQ,QAAA,gBACFH,OAAA,CAACR,SAAS;YACRmB,IAAI,EAAE,CAAC,WAAW,CAAE;YACpBN,KAAK,EAAE;cAAEa,UAAU,EAAE,KAAK;cAAEC,QAAQ,EAAE;YAAQ,CAAE;YAAAhB,QAAA,eAEhDH,OAAA,CAACX,QAAQ;cAAC+B,aAAa,EAAE,CAACtB,SAAS,CAAE;cAAAK,QAAA,EAClC;AACjB;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA,kHAAkH,CAACkB,OAAO,CACxG,KAAK,EACL,MACF;YAAC;cAAAd,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OACO;UAAC;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACF,CAAC,eACZV,OAAA,CAACR,SAAS;YACRa,KAAK,EAAE;cAAEiB,KAAK,EAAE,OAAO;cAAEH,QAAQ,EAAE;YAAQ,CAAE;YAC7CI,KAAK,EAAC;UAAW;YAAAhB,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACP,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACV,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACA;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACF,CAAC;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OACP,CAAC;AAEV;AAACc,EAAA,GAhJuBvB,GAAG;AAAA,IAAAuB,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
